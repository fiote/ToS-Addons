## Official Statement about Addons

https://treeofsavior.com/news/?n=467
> We have no plans on restricting add-ons that conveniently display information which can be obtained from external communities or between users.
> However, we are sternly against add-ons that allow abnormal gameplay such as being able to use NPC stores on a field or an auto-play program. Those are prohibited and its user is liable to be banned.

Because of that, I'll no longer keep cxAnywhere available. If you ever find yourself with it in your hands, that's not on me anymore. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED. I'm not using it anymore too (believe it or not).
